# XmlExtensions
A modding framework for RimWorld based on XML patch operations.
This mod does nothing by itself, however, it gives modders more XML patch operations that greatly increase the amount of things that they can do. It also allows for an easy way to create mod settings for your mod, even if your mod is only XML patches. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/15adhami/XmlExtensions/wiki) to learn more.
