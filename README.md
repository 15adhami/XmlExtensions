# XmlExtensions
A modding framework for RimWorld based on XML patch operations.
This mod does nothing by itself, however, it gives modders more XML patch operations that greatly increase the amount of things that they can do. It also allows for an easy way to create mod settings for your mod, even if your mod is only XML patches. WIP.
## Patch Operations
Vanilla patch operations only allow you to statically modify the definitions. This library gives you patch operations that allow you to write programs to edit the definitions instead.
